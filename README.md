# WebSocketServer

A WIP TypeScript websocket implementation for a multiplayer game server. Improvement over last attempt using Socket.IO which had issues on the client side (see [here](https://github.com/J0m1ty/UnityServer)).

C# client-side code for Unity will be coming soon, in a different repo.
